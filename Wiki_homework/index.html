  <p>
    <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup
    language <sup>[a]</sup> for documents designed to be displayed in a web
    browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
    languages such as JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
    structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its
    appearance.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
    images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
    rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
    links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
    written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code> < img > </code> and
    directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround
    and provide information about document text and may include sub-element
    tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the
    content of the page.

  <h3><strong>Development</strong></h3>
  <p>
    In 1980, physicist
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank"
      >Tim Berners-Lee</a
    >, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
    researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
    proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. <sup>[4]</sup> Berners-Lee
    specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That
    year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
    collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
    formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed
    "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the
    first entry.s <sup>[5]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML
    Tags",<sup>[6]</sup> first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in
    late 1991.<sup>[7]</sup><sup>[8]</sup> It describes 18 elements comprising
    the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag,
    these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard
    Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.
    Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4. <sup>[9]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose
    text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default
    characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
    and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page
    designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in
    the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
    describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used
    by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible
    Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were
    derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
    However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested
    annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with
    separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this
    direction with CSS.

    Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally
    defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the
    mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the
    "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan
    Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the
    syntax.<sup>[10]</sup><sup>[11]</sup> The draft expired after six months,
    but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom
    tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing
    standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing
    Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested
    standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out
    forms.<sup>[12]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an
    HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the
    first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which
    future implementations should be based.<sup>[13]</sup>

        HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866 Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
        <ol style="list-style-type: disc">

    <ol>
      <li style="list-style-type: none">
        HTML 3.2[16] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first
        version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF
        had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996. <sup>[17]</sup>
      </li>
      <li style="list-style-type: none">
        Initially code-named "Wilbur",[18] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas
        entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and
        adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element
        and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement
        between the two companies.[14] A markup for mathematical formulas
        similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.

      Initially code-named "Cougar",[18] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific
      element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's
      visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style
      sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[20]
