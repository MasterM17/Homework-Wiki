  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <hr />

  <p>
    <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup
    language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
    defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
    technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
    such as JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
    structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its
    appearance.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
    images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
    rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
    links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
    written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code></code> and directly
    introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide
    information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers
    do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the
    page.

  <h3><strong>Development</strong></h3>
  <p>
    In 1980, physicist
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank"
      >Tim Berners-Lee</a
    >, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
    researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
    proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML
    and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
    Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a
    joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
    In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in
    which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.s[5]

  <p>
    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML
    Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
    1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
    simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly
    influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
    (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still
    exist in HTML 4.[9]

  <p>
    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose
    text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default
    characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
    and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page
    designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in
    the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
    describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used
    by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible
    Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were
    derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
    However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested
    annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with
    separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this
    direction with CSS.

  <p>
    Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally
    defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the
    mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the
    "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan
    Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the
    syntax.[10][11] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its
    acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line
    images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful
    prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+
    (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
    already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[12]
